## Lessons Learned

I was struggling when trying  to implement a token and refresh token method of authentication and always endedup with a framework.

With this, i've learned how to consistent add a token with a short life and use a refresh token with a long life to generate a new token withou any user interaction.

Also when refresh token is expired, get a new one excluding the previous one.

No other frameworks were used but expressjs.
